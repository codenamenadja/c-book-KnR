CH02-Types, Operators, and Expressions
=======================================

2.4-Declarations
----------------

   Automatic variable
      They are initialized each time the function or block it is in is entered.
      *The initializer may be any expression.*

   Non Automatic variable
      If variabls is not automatic, initialization is done once only,
      Conceptually before the program starts executing,
      *And their initializer must be a constant expression.*

   External and static variable
      By default, they are initialized to zero.
      while automatic variable has undefined(garbage) values.

   ``const``
      The qualifier ``const`` can be applied to declaration of any variable to sepdictry that,
      It's value will not be changed.

2.7-Type Conversions
--------------------
   When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a common type according to a *small number of rules.*

   *small number of rules*
      convert a "narrower" operand into a "wider" one without losing information.

2.8-Increment and Decrement Operators
-------------------------------------

2.10-Assigment operators and expressions
